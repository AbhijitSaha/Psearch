IDL routines for Period search with hybrid algorithm

IDL routines for period finding with multiband data that are sparsely sampled.  Hybridizes Lomb-Scargle and Lafler-Kinman approaches. A paper is nearly ready to submit witha fuller description -- will be cited here when complete.  This repository is intended to include all the needed routines, many of which are already in existence and in the public domain.   -- June 28, 2017
